Checking your Target gift card balance is quick and simple through multiple methods. You can easily verify your balance online via Target’s official website, through the Target mobile app, or by calling customer service. Keeping track of your balance helps avoid surprises at checkout and lets you plan your purchases better. Additionally, adding your card to the Target app makes managing and using your gift cards even more convenient. Knowing these tips ensures you get the most out of your Target gift card every time you shop.

Why Knowing Your Target Gift Card Balance Matters
-------------------------------------------------

Imagine going to checkout with a gift card, only to find out there’s not enough balance to cover your purchase. Or worse — you don’t know how much you have left, so you’re guessing and wasting money.

Knowing your balance upfront means:

- No surprises at checkout
- You can plan your shopping better
- You can combine gift cards or pay the rest with another card

Three Simple Ways to Check Your Target Gift Card Balance
--------------------------------------------------------

1. **Check Your Balance Online**  

   This is the quickest way, no app or phone call needed.

   Go to: https://www.target.com/gift-card-balance

   Enter your gift card number — usually a 19-digit number on the back of your card or in your gift email.

   Enter your access code — scratch off the silver strip on the back of your physical card to reveal this code or find it in your email for digital cards.

   Click “Check Balance” and your available amount appears immediately.

2. **Use the Target Mobile App**  

   If you shop with Target often, the app makes checking balances and using gift cards a breeze.

   - Download and open the Target app (iOS and Android)
   - Sign in or create a free Target account
   - Tap **Wallet** in the app menu
   - Select **Gift Cards**, then tap **Add a Gift Card**
   - Enter your gift card number and access code

   Once added, your balance will always show in the app — no need to re-enter it.

   You can also scan the card barcode from the app at checkout, so no physical card is needed.

3. **Call Target Customer Service**  

   Prefer to talk to a human or don’t have internet access?

   Call **1-800-544-2943** to check your balance by phone.

   Have your card number and access code ready to provide.

What If Your Balance Isn’t Showing Correctly?
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes things don’t go as planned. Here’s what to do:

- Double-check you’re entering the numbers correctly. Watch out for confusing characters like “B” vs “8” or “O” vs “0.”

- If you get an error saying your card isn’t valid, make sure it’s an official Target gift card, not a prepaid Visa or other store card.

- If you lost your access code or the scratch-off part is damaged, contact Target Support for help.

- If you suspect your card was used without your permission, call Target immediately.

Tips for Using Your Target Gift Card
------------------------------------

- Use the full balance. If you have a small leftover amount, add another payment method for the remainder.

- Combine multiple cards. You can use more than one Target gift card in a single purchase.

- Use online or in-store. Gift cards work in both places.

- Add cards to the Target app. Keeps them all in one place and easy to access.

- Register your card online. Helps recover your balance if you lose the card.
